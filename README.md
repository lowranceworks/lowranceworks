        <h2>🤔 Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Paula Morton · Digital Strategy Director at Avaya</b>
        </p>
        Josh was a great asset to his team during the time we worked together at CTIntegrations and Avaya. Navigating unfamiliar
        territory and finding our own way, Josh was able to successfully deploy resources in GCP, using a variety of both familiar
        and new dev deployment technologies. It's clear he has a real passion for forward thinking best practices in DevOps and
        was a thought leader on the team, when it came to how we would evolve our technology to true CI/CD processes and tech.
        When faced with a challenge or problem to solve, Josh doesn't back down or give up easily, and stays focused on the prize
        until he is successful. He is a real team player that his peers can count on to deliver.
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Ronny Flaatten · Chief Technical Officer at CTIntegrations (Avaya company)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Josh is an incredibly talented engineer, the speed at which he not only learns but master new technologies is
          impressive. His work ethic is outstanding, and he always delivers! We were in a transformation as a software
          company and required the team to wear many hats and be able to adapt to new technologies quickly; Josh was an
          essential part of this transformation, and he never wavered.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Jeff Hunt · Engineering Manager at Arrive Logistics</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't say enough good things about Josh. He's driven, positive and committed. He brightens up a room when he
          walks in and stays focused approaching any situation or problem. He keeps an open mind when troubleshooting and
          tries to look at things from different angles when stuck, which leads to unique and inventive solutions. It was
          an absolute pleasure working with Josh and any company would be improved having him on their payroll.
